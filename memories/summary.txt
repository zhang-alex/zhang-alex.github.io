2022 was an odd year. After finding out that us students might be getting kicked out of our dorms because of a COVID-related housing shortage, Anna and I embarked on a cross-country road trip from Tennessee to campus, prepared to take a leave until we were guaranteed housing. It was so nice to have a place to ourselves and to get to cook again. 

In March, I got my first internship! We decided to move to Maryland for a change of scenery. The beaches were gorgeous. We visited Niagara Falls and also visited our dear friend Tracey. I started my internship in June. 

2022 was also the year I became an RA for Schiff house and met an amazing group of co-staff and residents. 

In October, I got my second internship with Bloomberg! I got to visit NYC which was an amazing experience. As fall quarter came to a close, Anna and I took a trip to Europe, just ourselves, something we'd been planning since September and were both finally in a good enough financial position to do so.
